#data-structures

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.


This is an implementation of many data structures and their associated algorithms in using various instantiation patterns. This repo includes Hashtables, Linked Lists, Graphs, Binary Trees, B-Trees, Bloom Filters, Prefix Trees, and more.
